# Page-on-Android-Kernel

The project Android Memory Management is about page table and page re- placement algorithm in linux kernel.

There are four tasks in this project:

      1. Compile the Android kernel.

      2. Familiarize Android page replacement algorithm.

      3. Get the target process’s virtual address and physical address. 

      4. Implement a page replacement aging algorithm.

The main objectives of the project are:

      • Gain basic knowledge of Android kernel compilation

      • Master the pagetable arrangement in Android

      • Understand Page Replacement Algorithm of Linux
